## Key Features Explained

### Session-Based Isolation
Each user gets a unique session ID stored in localStorage, ensuring their todos remain private without requiring authentication.

### Offline Support
The app includes a service worker and offline API fallback to ensure functionality even without an internet connection.

### Optimistic Updates
Using TanStack Query's optimistic update pattern, UI changes appear instantly before server confirmation, with automatic rollback on errors.

### Smart Filtering
Filter todos by:
- **Priority**: urgent, high, medium, low
- **Status**: all, completed, pending
- **List**: filter by specific todo list

### Dark Mode
Seamless dark mode toggle using next-themes with system preference detection and persistent user preference.
